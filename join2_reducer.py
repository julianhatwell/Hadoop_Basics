#This reducer code will input a <word, value> input file, and join words together
# Note the input will come as a group of lines with same word (ie the key)
# As it reads words it will hold on to the value field
#
# It will keep track of current word and previous word, if word changes
#   then it will perform the 'join' on the set of held values by merely printing out 
#   the word and values.  In other words, there is no need to explicitly match keys b/c
#   Hadoop has already put them sequentially in the input 
#   
# At the end it will perform the last join
#
#
#  Note, there is NO error checking of the input, it is assumed to be correct, meaning
#   it has word with correct and matching entries, no extra spaces, etc.
